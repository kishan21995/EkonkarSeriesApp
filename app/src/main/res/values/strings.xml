    <string name="mission">The mission of my organisation is to remove disparties
                           among people by solving the mystry of God, abolish religious
                           fanatism and establish peace in the world We are the creation
                           of nature . The whole Universe consist of five basic elements -
                           air , water , earth , fire and space . An old saying Yat Brahmande
                           tat Pinde proves to be true . Our body is also made up of these five elements .
                           The life can emerge on any planet where these five elements are present in a
                           balanced state . It will happen only in a natural way. This process is continuing
                           for the time immemorial . There are hundeds of galaxies and thousands of planets and
                           stars in the universe . Matter can neither  be created nor distroyed science says but
                           changes its form . Similarly Atma changes its body after death. </string>
